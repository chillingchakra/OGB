    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s a sad day, here I was thinking I would go against the hipster grain that is learning Ruby and Rails and perhaps learn a counter-culture language like Perl or Haskell and then find a web framework with them but it seems Octopress has sent me into Ruby with how easy everything is to configure.</p>

<p>I shall experiment and we will have to see. I’m also going to have a look at Drupal as Linux Journal seems crazy excited about its very existence.</p>

<p>This Markdown craze isn’t something I’m crazy about either. I have to go and learn a whole new micro HTML-esque thing that lets me format my posts just the way I want.</p>
