    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Unfortunately due to the weirdness that is git, I have failed to move forward. I&rsquo;ve accidentally erased a number of my source files and YAML config files and as a result have had to start from scratch.</p>

<p>I will see how all this goes but until then I offer up an image for your viewing pleasure.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s a sad day, here I was thinking I would go against the hipster grain that is learning Ruby and Rails and perhaps learn a counter-culture language like Perl or Haskell and then find a web framework with them but it seems Octopress has sent me into Ruby with how easy everything is to configure.</p>

<p>I shall experiment and we will have to see. I’m also going to have a look at Drupal as Linux Journal seems crazy excited about its very existence.</p>

<p>This Markdown craze isn’t something I’m crazy about either. I have to go and learn a whole new micro HTML-esque thing that lets me format my posts just the way I want.</p>
