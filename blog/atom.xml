    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m going to be trying to get a grip on this SASS er SCSS thing from here on in. I feel it would be helpful. I have some limited understanding of CSS already. I’ve pretty much gotten past toying around with the YAML config file that comes with octopress, although I may add a sidebar aside of my own. The rake file doesn’t seem to really help me in any way, so I suppose all thats left is tweaking the appearance of everything by playing around with the Sassafrass Sass infrastructure.</p>

<p>This not drinking thing is surprisingly refreshing. I feel good and have the spirit and perseverance to take in knowledge like I couldn’t when hungover. My hair is growing into something spectacular, especially since I changed where the part is. I sort of have a Willliam H Macy going on right now, circa Shameless more than say Fargo. I don’t remember what the fuck he had going on in Fargo.</p>

<p>I downloaded some book on self-diagnosing handwriting problems, I wish to improve my cursive penmanship and send more letters. I like writing letters on actual paper and would like to more. I may even join a penpal collective of some sort, although I find the idea of asking random strangers how their days are rather dull.</p>

<p>I have some things on my agenda such as beginning a regular workout schedule to take place everyday on my wooden floor, I also have 3 days left of the pain that is community service, but I wish to get them out of the way. Soon I will begin working on getting my car back. Mass money is of course a precursor.</p>

<p>I’ve also been experimenting with my kombucha, I tried to add less than the reccomended amount of sugar but this backfired, so I shall just add the reccomended amount as not to have it come out tasting like sour water. I’ve also been chopping up blueberries and throwing them in the finished product and letting it stand in the fridge for 3 days and then drinking that, its’ wonderful. I think I shall try mandarin peels next as they have a great effect on the digestive system which should compliment the benefits of kombucha greatly.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sadly most of the better things that pop into my head end up on Facebook, a walled off garden. Although people can &ldquo;follow&rdquo; your public posts, things are mostly limited to your &ldquo;friends&rdquo;. Which is okay because most of my things have an attachment of my own personality to them and perhaps a public person which does not know me personally will take it significantly differently than a person I do personally know (Facebook &ldquo;friends&rdquo;).</p>

<p>I sort of occasionally take a swing at Twitter, but I don&rsquo;t really care for it very much. The 140 character limit feels like enslavement by some sadist who simply doesn&rsquo;t want anybody to be able to rant. Nobody comes off as angry because they are limited to 140 character and as a result, no other person reading the first persons stuff is inspired by their message to cause reform of some sort. So it&rsquo;s mostly for humor, comedians seem to do well with it.</p>

<p>I like Instagram, and the community at least seems to enjoy my contributions because I take interesting photos and play around with various Photoshop tools as well as Vingnette on Android.
There isn&rsquo;t really a lot of interaction on Instagram though, it&rsquo;s just hearts and the occasional comment (seldom anything of use). It&rsquo;s other great use is looking at pretty chicks. Man, pretty chicks are a plenty on Instagram. I think sometimes Instagram would be an interesting bare-bones dating site experiment. I noticed a while ago that Tinder got tired of people posting their Instagram links at the bottom of their Tinder profiles and built a Instagram clone right into the Tinder app.</p>

<p>So some of my better stuff is on Facebook, as such, I found a neat plugin that should allow for an embed and will proceed to try it out below and then RAKE that shit.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Unfortunately due to the weirdness that is git, I have failed to move forward. I&rsquo;ve accidentally erased a number of my source files and YAML config files and as a result have had to start from scratch.</p>

<p>I will see how all this goes but until then I offer up an image for your viewing pleasure.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s a sad day, here I was thinking I would go against the hipster grain that is learning Ruby and Rails and perhaps learn a counter-culture language like Perl or Haskell and then find a web framework with them but it seems Octopress has sent me into Ruby with how easy everything is to configure.</p>

<p>I shall experiment and we will have to see. I’m also going to have a look at Drupal as Linux Journal seems crazy excited about its very existence.</p>

<p>This Markdown craze isn’t something I’m crazy about either. I have to go and learn a whole new micro HTML-esque thing that lets me format my posts just the way I want.</p>
